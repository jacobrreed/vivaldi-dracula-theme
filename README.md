## Vivaldi Dracula Theme
A dark theme for Vivaldi browser based on the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/). Not the official theme, but I've added Dracula purple for inactive tabs and Dracula pink bold for active tab.
I plan on adding an icon pack at some point.

### Installation
1. Install from [Vivaldi Theme Store](https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/3rKlwgoAlaD/versions/3) **or** Download the `vivaldi-dracula.zip` file from the this repo (***This will install the theme only, not the CSS (next step will do that)***)
2. Download the [vivaldi-dracula.css](https://github.com/jacobrreed/vivaldi-dracula-theme/blob/master/vivaldi-dracula.cssg?raw=true) and place it somewhere that you want to store this **or** clone this repo
3. To enable custom CSS:
    - Go to `vivaldi://experiments`
    - Check `Allow for using CSS modifications`
    - Go to `vivaldi://settings/appearance/`
    - Under `CUSTOM UI MODIFICATION`
      - `Select Folder...` and select the folder where you placed the `vivaldi-dracula.css` file
      - NOTE: This will load all CSS files in that directory
4. Restart Vivaldi


#### Future TODOs:
- [ ] Icon pack
- [ ] More CSS modification to make things more Dracula like
